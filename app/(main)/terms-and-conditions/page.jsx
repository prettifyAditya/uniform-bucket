            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our
              sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Some situations that may result in your order being
              cancelled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing
              information, problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department, or any defect regarding the quality of
              the product. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact
              you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If
              your order is cancelled after your credit card has been charged, the said amount will be reversed back in your Card
              Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of usual business practice, if we receive a cancellation notice and the order has not been dispatched by us, we
              shall cancel the order and refund the entire amount. The company holds the discretionary right to refund the amount as
              customer points/check or bank refund. UB points cannot be availed as cash. Orders can only be refunded in the mode used
              at the time of purchase.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Provision</h3>
            <p>
              Should any provision of this agreement be legally void, this does not invalidate the whole contract. Instead, the
              invalid provision shall be replaced with an effective provision with the same economic purpose. The same applies to
              possible gaps in this contract.
            </p>
            <p>

              unreasonable changes, especially pertaining to essential contract elements, such as the main benefits owed, which would
              be subject to a contract modification. Uniformbucket will notify you of changes to the Terms and Conditions in a timely
              fashion. Notification of changes will include a reference to the possibility and the period of objection and the
              significance or consequences of the omission of contradiction. If you do not contradict the validity of the amended
              Terms and Conditions within two weeks of the day following the receipt of the notification of change to you, the amended
              terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted by you.
